This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in VBScript related to the behavior of the IsEmpty function when used with variant types that are not explicitly assigned a value. The bug arises due to a subtle interaction between VBScript's type system and its handling of unassigned variants.  The provided solution offers a more robust approach to handle empty or missing input values.
